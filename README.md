As the transportation and logistics industries move into the post-pandemic era of transformed customer behavior, rapidly-evolving sectoral issues, and more unprecedented changes, machine learning proves an exceptionally timely and effective solution against such economic inhibitions.As the transportation and logistics industries move into the post-pandemic era of transformed customer behavior, rapidly-evolving sectoral issues, and more unprecedented changes, machine learning proves an exceptionally timely and effective solution against such economic inhibitions.

The transport and logistics industry continues to be challenged by tough competition as well as the covid pandemic and net zero emissions targets. To emerge in a strong position, companies must consider how they leverage the tools available to maximise efficiency and build a foundation for the future. Machine learning, integrated successfully, exploits the tight margins needed to be competitive in the fast-growing global intelligent transport market. But only with a strong data strategy can you set your business apart from others hopping in on the trend. Now with a better understanding of how data and machine learning work together, you can generate increased values from your operations while building the foundation for the future of your business.
